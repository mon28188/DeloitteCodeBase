# LWC Base Components

### What is a Base Component?
A Base component is a Lightning Web Component (LWC) that is used across PostNL project to maintain the performance as well as the look and feel consistency.
Base component provides different flavours of UI for the same component.
For example:
- Input field:

	- You can have different sizes of input field

	![fieldSize](../../wiki/assets/fieldSize.png)

	- You can optionally make the field required, disabled by using the public attributes on the input field base component.

	![required](../../wiki/assets/requiredField.png)
	![disabled](../../wiki/assets/disabledField.png)

	- You can have place holder if needed

	![placeholder](../../wiki/assets/placeholder.png)
